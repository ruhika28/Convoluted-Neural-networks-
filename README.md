# Convoluted-Neural-networks-
created  a CNN in order to   process MINST data set with  2   hidden layers  with 99 % accuracy  in python using Keras. 
Accuray was found out to be 99%  the train and test data  was divided  with 60000 observations as train and 10000 observations as validation set
Max pool was done in order to  minimize the  loss of the image shape.
